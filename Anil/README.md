# Project README

This repository contains a team project where I, [Your Name], contributed by creating an HTML page with associated CSS for a specific section. The HTML and CSS files are organized within a folder named after me.

## Tags Used

1. **Semantic Tags:**
   - `<head>`: Used for metadata and included the `<title>` and `<link>` for favicon.
   - `<main>`: Utilized for the main content section.

2. **Non-Semantic Tags:**
   - `<div>`: Used for general grouping and styling.
   - `<img>`: Employed for embedding images.
   - `<a>`: Utilized for creating hyperlinks.

## External Libraries

I incorporated the [AOS (Animate On Scroll) library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) to add scroll-triggered animations to enhance the user experience.

## CSS Properties

1. **Background:**
   - `background-color`: Applied for setting the background color.

2. **Grid:**
   - Utilized the CSS Grid for arranging images in a row-wise fashion.

3. **Media Queries:**
   - Implemented media queries to ensure responsiveness for screen sizes.
